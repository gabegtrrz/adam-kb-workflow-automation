THE EPP WAY
What is EPP?
The Enriched Potting Preparation (EPP) technology
provides urban families with healthy and pesticide-free
How to grow vegetables, herbs, and or
HOY EPP way namentals
Materials needed:
1.5-liter (L) empty plastic softdri
- potting medium me ee
compost soil extract (CSE)
- nylon string
Procedure:
Preparing the plastic-bottle container
1. Cut the plastic bottles in half.
2. Put small holes on the sides of both top and bottom half
of the bottle for aeration and drainage of excess water.
3. Place the potting medium inside the inverted top half
with the bottle cap.
4. Use the bottom half as a stand for the top half to collect
and reserve excess water for plant's reuse.
Mm
Sowing the seeds
1. Sow2o0r more seeds and cover with 1 millimeter (mm)
of the potting medium.
2. Remove the upper part and wet the potting medium by
dipping the plastic bottle container into a pail of water.
3. Put back the container by putting bottom part on top of
the soil surface.
4. Place the EPP in shaded area until seeds germinate, then
place it where seeds can receive morning sunshine.
5. If needed, transplant extra seedlings to other EPP.
6. Place EPP where plant can receive at least 2 hours of full
sunlight.
Watering the plants
Water the plants three times a week for seedlings or once a
day for mature plants by dipping the EPP vessel into a pail of
water or by sprinkling until the soil is fully wet.
Fertilizing using CSE
1. Dilute CSEin a ratio of five tablespoons of CSE to 1 Lâ€œet
water.
2. Water the plant with about 100 milliliters (mL) of the
diluted solution once a week during seedling stage and
twice a week as the plant matures.
3. For pest control, dip the whole EPP plant into a clean
pail of water for 15 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the
severity of the pest infection.
4. For green leafy vegetables such as pechay and lettuce,
harvest leaves using scissors. Leave the younger leaves
and let them grow until ready for the next harvest.
What are the benefits of EPP?
Plants are easier to care for and tend.
There is a continued harvest of fresh, succulent leafy
vegetables.
Vegetables can be grown 6 cycles/year.
It is most appropriate in urban areas.
Lateral and vertical expansion of planting can be done.
It helps in waste recycling efforts of the community as it
uses non-biodegradable plastic bottles.
The organic potting medium is porous, nutrient-rich, and
free from toxic elements.
It can be hung or set to stand.
It is moveable and easy to transport during heavy rains
or if thereis too much heat.
